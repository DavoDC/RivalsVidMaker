## Labelled Frames

> **Important:** These labels mark frames where the banner was **clearly visible**,
> NOT the exact frame where the banner first appeared. The banner may have appeared
> 1–5 frames earlier. Use these as approximate reference points, not precise onset times.

## Banner Visual Properties (from labelled frames)

- **Position**: right ~20-25% of screen width, vertically ~40-60% of screen height
- **Appearance**: slides in from the right edge; stays 2-4 seconds per tier
- **Style**: cyan/blue circular icon (Thor hammer) + white text on dark translucent panel
- **Text values**: `KO` → `DOUBLE!` → `TRIPLE!` → `QUAD!` → `PENTA!` → `HEXA!`
- **Colour is character-dependent** — not reliable for detection:
  | Character     | Banner colour                              |
  |---------------|--------------------------------------------|
  | Thor          | Vivid electric blue/cyan (~R=0, G=160, B=240) |
  | Squirrel Girl | Vivid gold/yellow (~R=220, G=180, B=0)     |
- Banner text is **white** on a dark background regardless of character
- Saturation heuristic (character-agnostic): `max(R,G,B) > 180 AND max(R,G,B) - min(R,G,B) > 100`

## Crop Region for Detection

To isolate the banner, crop to:
- X: 75–100% of frame width (right 25%)
- Y: 40–62% of frame height

FFmpeg filter: `crop=iw*0.25:ih*0.22:iw*0.75:ih*0.40`

The labelled frames confirm this crop captures the banner cleanly without
other HUD elements (kill feed is top-right, health bar is bottom-centre).

## Detection Approach: OCR (Recommended)

**Why OCR beats pixel/saturation heuristics:**
- Saturation heuristic fires on any vivid region (maps with neon lighting,
  energy effects, etc.) → false positives
- OCR reads the actual text → zero ambiguity
- Banner text is large, high-contrast (white on dark) → easy for OCR

**Why OCR beats template matching:**
- Template matching requires a reference image per tier (3+ PNG files to maintain)
- Fails if game patches the UI visuals or resolution/UI scale changes
- OCR handles font variations and will pick up new kill tiers automatically
- Template matching is faster (~3–8ms/frame vs ~50–150ms) but 2fps scanning
  means speed is not a concern — accuracy matters more

**Recommended stack:** Python + `pytesseract` + `Pillow`

**Steps per clip:**
1. Use FFmpeg to extract frames at 2fps (sufficient; banners last 2-4s each)
2. Crop each frame to the banner region (right 25%, y 40-62%)
3. Pre-process crop: scale 3x, invert (white text → dark for Tesseract), sharpen
4. Run `pytesseract.image_to_string()` with PSM 8 → PSM 7 → PSM 6 fallback
5. Check if result contains any of: `KO`, `DOUBLE`, `TRIPLE`, `QUAD`, `PENTA`, `HEXA`
6. Apply 2s cooldown between distinct events (prevents double-counting same banner)
7. Record event tier + timestamp

**Performance at 2fps (30s clips):** ~60 frames extracted per clip.
OCR at ~50–150ms/frame = ~3–9 seconds per clip. Acceptable; cache means re-runs are instant.

For context on a full 15-min compiled video at native fps (not used — we scan clips individually):
- 15 min @ 60fps = 54,000 frames; template matching ~3min, OCR ~45–135min (impractical)
- Sampling every 10 frames at 2fps = 180 frames; OCR ~9–27 seconds total — fast enough

## YouTube Description Timestamp Goal

Timestamps in the description are **relative to the compiled video, not the clip.**

```
compiled video timestamp = running_video_offset + clip_event_timestamp
```

Example: clip starts at 3:20 in the compiled video, Quad kill at 0:40 within the clip → description entry at 4:00.

Timestamp range format and threshold (Quad+ only): see `docs/YOUTUBE_TITLE_AND_DESC.md`.

## This Clip's Output (When Working Correctly)

This clip is the first clip in vid1 (batch1). Within the clip itself:

- **Quad kill at: 0:20** (frame 1192, at 2fps scan)
- **Sequence window: 0:06 – 0:22** (KO banner first appears at ~0:06, Quad banner at ~0:20)

In the compiled video, this clip is clip 1 with no preceding offset. Verified timestamp:
`0:06 - 0:22 = Quad Kill` (confirmed accurate by manual playback — see CLAUDE.md).

## Validated Test Clips

Clips verified correct by watching the actual video after running `ko_detect.py`:

| Clip | Expected | Script output | Window | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `THOR_2026-02-06_22-38-56.mp4` | QUAD | QUAD | 0:06 → 0:22 | ✅ |
| `THOR_2026-02-17_23-25-25.mp4` | TRIPLE | TRIPLE | 0:06 → 0:14 | ✅ |

**Known false negatives (manual review 2026-03-31):**

| Clip | Manually observed | Script output | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `THOR_2026-03-17_22-20-29.mp4` | KO at ~8s, then assists | null | Bug - missed |
| `THOR_2026-03-22_23-19-10.mp4` | KO at ~8s, then assists | null | Bug - missed |
| `THOR_2026-03-27_22-23-58.mp4` | KO at ~8s, clip ends | null | Bug - missed |
| `THOR_2026-03-28_23-22-42.mp4` | KO at ~8s, nothing else (18.5s clip) | null | Bug - missed |
| `THOR_2026-03-26_22-37-28.mp4` | KO at 18.5s (single-frame flash), DOUBLE at 25.9s (39s clip) | null | Pass 1 misses the KO (single-frame) and early-exits before 25.9s. Pass 2 fixed this, but pass 2 is being removed (B1). Clip will be flagged for deletion. |

**Notes on misses:** DOUBLE was missed in the TRIPLE clip (banner visible ~1s, fell between 2fps sample points). Acceptable - intermediate tiers don't affect final classification as long as the highest tier is caught.

**Known limitations:**
- Short banners (<1s) may be missed at 2fps - mostly affects KO/DOUBLE, not Quad+
- `KO` (2 chars) is harder for Tesseract than longer tier names like `TRIPLE` or `QUAD`
- **Single-KO false negatives (confirmed bug):** 4 clips with visible KO banners at ~8s returned null (THOR_2026-03-17_22-20-29, THOR_2026-03-22_23-19-10, THOR_2026-03-27_22-23-58, THOR_2026-03-28_23-22-42). Crop region confirmed correct (same position as multi-kill banners). Root cause: 2fps has a 0.5s miss window - KO banner can appear and disappear between samples. Fix: raise `SCAN_FPS` to 4. See IDEAS.md.
- **Single-frame KO banners (~0.125s):** confirmed in THOR_2026-03-26_22-37-28 -- KO banner at 18.5s lasted ~0.125s, always missed by pass 1 at 2fps. Previously fixed by pass 2; pass 2 is being removed (B1 design). These clips will be flagged for deletion -- accepted tradeoff.
- **Not all highlight clips are multi-kills:** The game's DVR saves single-KO + assist sequences too. These scan as null or KO-tier. Pass 1 only is the intended scanner; clips where pass 1 finds nothing or only a single KO are prompted for deletion. Only DOUBLE+ from pass 1 go into compilations - see B1 in IDEAS.md.
- **Kill-cam false positives (stream VODs only):** When the player dies in a stream VOD (raw game recording), the game shows the killer's POV during the respawn wait. The killer can chain multi-kills in this window, and their KO banners appear in the same region as the player's own banners. Does NOT affect saved highlight clips - those are always the player's own kills captured by the in-game DVR. Only relevant for OldCompilations stream VODs. See IDEAS.md for notes.

## Notes / Gotchas

- The gap between Triple (0:23) and Quad (0:40) is ~17 seconds — kills can be
  spaced far apart. Don't assume kills are clustered.
- Frame 304 (0:10) shows no banner yet — the "starting" label marks when
  game action leading to the kill streak begins, not when the banner appears.
- The same banner tier stays on screen for multiple seconds — use rising-edge
  detection (inactive → active transition) to count distinct events.
- A 2s cooldown after each detected event prevents counting the same
  banner frame twice.
